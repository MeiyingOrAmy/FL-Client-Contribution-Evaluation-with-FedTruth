# FL-Client-Contribution-Evaluation-with-FedTruth
This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook [FRECA_FL_client_contrib_eval_FedTruth.ipynb] that implements FRECA (Fair, Robust, and Efficient Client Assessment) method proposed in the paper “Towards Fair, Robust and Efficient Client Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning”. Published at IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2024. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04409

The returned values 'aw, contrib' of the function 'fedtruth' correspond to FRECA AW and FRECA Net as described in Section V (EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS) of the paper. 
This code is written for MNIST dataset and CNN model which can be replaced with other datasets and models.
